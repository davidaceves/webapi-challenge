1. Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
 
   Two parts of Express that I learned about are middleware and routing.

2. Describe Middleware?

   Middleware is essentially a string of functions that run sequentially. Middleware has three distinct types: built-in, third party, and custom.

3. Describe a Resource?
   
   A resource is basically an object that can be acted on upon by CRUD operations	

4. What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

   The API will return a status code of 200 or 201 to state if the request was successful.

5. How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

   In order to partition an application into sub-applications you must make use of Express Routers. Express Routers allow you to break up your code into more manageable and modular blocks of code.
